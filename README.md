# gator_name_analysis
A script I wrote to scrape the names of every business in the state of Florida registered with Florida Sunbiz fictitious names registry that contained the string "gator" or "swamp". Used for a story (and viz) about how many businesses in Gainesville use the word Gator, why they choose to, and when such name registrations proliferate (hint: when the gators are good).
